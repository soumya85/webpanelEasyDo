# ✅ MobileChatList Translation Error Fixed!

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The `MobileChatList` component was trying to use the `t` function for translations but didn't have access to it, causing:

```
ReferenceError: t is not defined
at MobileChatList (line 3383:50)
```

## 🔧 Root Cause

When I updated the Chats page to use the global translation system, I only added the `useGlobalTranslation` hook to the main `Chats` component. However, the `MobileChatList` component is defined as a separate component within the same file and it was trying to use:

```typescript
placeholder={t("search")}  // ❌ t was not defined in this component
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

**Added Translation Hook to MobileChatList Component:**

```typescript
const MobileChatList: React.FC<{
  // ... props
}> = (
  {
    // ... prop destructuring
  },
) => {
  const { t } = useGlobalTranslation(); // ✅ Added this line
  const filterTabs = ["All", "Unread", "Groups", "Labels", "Archived"];
  // ... rest of component
};
```

## 🎯 What's Fixed

✅ **MobileChatList Component** - Now has access to translation function  
✅ **Search Placeholder** - Now translates correctly on mobile  
✅ **No More Reference Errors** - All components have proper translation access  
✅ **Mobile Chat Interface** - Fully functional with translations
